/**
 * Issue #92 — barrel-hinge geometry compiler.
 *
 * Layout overview
 * ---------------
 *  - The hinge runs along one of the four side faces (±x or ±y).
 *  - `numKnuckles` cylindrical knuckles alternate between the case (even
 *    indices: 0, 2, 4, …) and the lid (odd indices: 1, 3, 5, …) along the
 *    face's u-axis. The end knuckles are case-attached so the lid pivots
 *    between matched pairs and the part stays printable.
 *  - All knuckles share a single axis. The axis lies in the face plane and
 *    is parallel to the face's u-direction, offset OUT of the case envelope
 *    by knuckleOuterDiameter/2 so the knuckle solids sit just past the wall.
 *  - Axis Z = outerZ - knuckleOuterDiameter/2. With this choice, the lid's
 *    bottom edge is the rotation pivot; opening the lid sweeps the upper
 *    cavity rim AWAY from the hinge — the standard barrel-hinge motion.
 *  - A single through-hole is subtracted along the axis spanning the full
 *    hingeLength + 1 mm overshoot (so the hole exits cleanly past both ends
 *    even after manifold rounding).
 *  - For the print-in-place style we also emit a centered pin solid filling
 *    the through-hole, with knuckleClearance/2 of slop on each side.
 *
 * Coordinate frames
 * -----------------
 *  - `caseAdditive` ops are in WORLD coordinates (case shell space).
 *  - `lidAdditive` ops are in LID-LOCAL coordinates: ProjectCompiler does
 *    `translate([0, 0, lidDims.zPosition], lidOp)` after calling buildLid,
 *    so anything we contribute to the lid must subtract that Z.
 *  - `subtractive` ops (through-holes) are in WORLD coordinates and applied
 *    to the SHELL only; manifold's union with the lid's separate knuckle
 *    drills the same hole because the bore axis is shared.
 *
 *    NOTE: in v1 the lid is rendered straight-down in Complete view (not
 *    rotated closed about the hinge axis). The through-hole is shared with
 *    the lid in CLOSED-state world coordinates, so we drill it on the lid
 *    in lid-local coordinates here too — same axis, same radius.
